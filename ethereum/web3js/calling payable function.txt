Level Up!
Recall in ZombieHelper, we added a payable function where the user can level up:

function levelUp(uint _zombieId) external payable {
  require(msg.value == levelUpFee);
  zombies[_zombieId].level++;
}
The way to send Ether along with a function is simple, with one caveat: we need to specify how much to send in wei, not Ether.

What's a Wei?
A wei is the smallest sub-unit of Ether — there are 10^18 wei in one ether.

That's a lot of zeroes to count — but luckily Web3.js has a conversion utility that does this for us.

// This will convert 1 ETH to Wei
web3js.utils.toWei("1");
In our DApp, we set levelUpFee = 0.001 ether, so when we call our levelUp function, we can make the user send 0.001 Ether along with it using the following code:

cryptoZombies.methods.levelUp(zombieId)
.send({ from: userAccount, value: web3js.utils.toWei("0.001", "ether") })
