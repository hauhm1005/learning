It’s common practice to specify a key attribute for every iterated element within a rendered v-for
list. Vue uses the key attribute to create unique bindings for each node’s identity.
To specify this uniqueness to each item in the list, we’ll assign a key to every iterated submission.
We’ll use the id of a submission since a submission’s id would never be equal to that of another
submission. Because we’re using dynamic values, we’ll need to use v-bind to bind our key to the
submission.id:
I - Your first Vue.js Web Application 20
<article v-for="submission in submissions" v-bind:key="submission.id"
class="media">
<!-- Rest of the submission template -->
</article>
If there were any dynamic changes made to a v-for list without the key attribute, Vue will opt
towards changing data within each element instead of moving the DOM elements accordingly. By
specifying a unique key attribute to each iterated item, we’re now telling Vue to reorder elements if
needed.
